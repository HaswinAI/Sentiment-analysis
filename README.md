Sentiment Analysis Project

This project implements a sentiment analysis application using the Groq API for language understanding and TextBlob for sentiment scoring. The application is built with Flask to provide a web-based interface for users to input product reviews and receive sentiment analysis results. The project includes an endpoint for analyzing sentiments and a simple chatbot interface.

Features

Sentiment Analysis:

Uses the Groq API to process user input and generate responses.

TextBlob is employed to calculate sentiment polarity and classify it as positive, negative, or neutral.

Chatbot Interface:

A basic chatbot to handle general queries and echo user inputs.

Error Handling:

Handles various API errors, including invalid API keys, unauthorized access, and unexpected issues.

Provides descriptive error messages for better debugging and user experience.
